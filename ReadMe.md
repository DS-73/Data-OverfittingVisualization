## Objective
This is a demonstration project where we visualize problem of data overfitting in Machine Learning.

## Description 
In this project we have visualize data overfitting using multiple graphs and to visualize this concept we have used sin(x) curve with gaussian error.
To achieve this we tried to fit data using polyfit() and got very good results which clearly demonstrate the negative effects of dataoverfitting.
